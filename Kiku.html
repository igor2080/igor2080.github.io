        While many think of cherry blossoms as Japan’s most iconic flower, the chrysanthemum
        holds a special place in Japanese history. It is the symbol of the Imperial Family, appearing
        on the official seal of the emperor. The flower represents nobility, rejuvenation, and long
        life, making it a central figure in Japanese culture.

        These flowers are well-known for their longevity and resilience, making them popular in
        floral arrangements and gardens. Each autumn, Japan hosts Kiku Matsuri
        (Chrysanthemum Festivals), where intricate floral displays celebrate the beauty and
        prestige of this remarkable flower.
