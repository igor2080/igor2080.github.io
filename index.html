        Japanese flowers
    </h2>
    <p>Japan is home to some of the world’s most breathtaking flowers, each carrying a deep
        cultural significance. From delicate cherry blossoms that symbolize the fleeting nature of
        life to vibrant chrysanthemums that represent longevity and joy, Japanese flowers offer a
        rich tapestry of beauty and meaning. These blooms aren’t just admired for their aesthetic
        appeal; they hold a special place in art, literature, and everyday life.

    <p>Among them, the kiku (chrysanthemum) stands out as a symbol of longevity and joy. It is a
        perennial flowering plant with a wide variety of cultivars, chrysanthemums bloom in
        shades of yellow, white, red, and purple. Their petals can be single-layered or densely
        packed, creating a full, rounded appearance. Blooming mainly in autumn, they are highly
        valued for their long-lasting flowers and resilience in cooler weather. <a href="/Kiku.html">Read more...</a>

    <p>Ajisai (hydrangea) is a deciduous shrub that produces large, globe-like clusters of flowers
        in shades of blue, purple, pink, or white. The color of the flowers changes depending on the
        acidity of the soil—acidic soil produces blue flowers, while alkaline soil results in pink
        blooms. Hydrangeas thrive in Japan’s rainy season and are commonly seen in temple
        gardens and along mountain paths. <a href="/Ajisai.html">Read more...</a>
